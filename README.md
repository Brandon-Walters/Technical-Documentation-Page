## Writing and Running a Rust Program
Now that you've installed Rust, it's time to write your first Rust program. This section guides you through the process of creating a project directory, writing a simple "Hello, world!" program, and running it.

## Anatomy of a Rust Program
Learn about the structure of a Rust program, including defining functions, code blocks, and statements. This section explains the main function, function body, and the println! macro used for printing text to the screen.

## Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps
In Rust, compiling and running a program are separate steps. This section explains the process of compiling a Rust program using the rustc compiler and running the executable file generated.

## CSS Styling
The documentation is styled using CSS to enhance readability and provide a better user experience. Styles include formatting for headers, navigation, code blocks, and responsive design for smaller screens.
